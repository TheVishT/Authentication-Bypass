# Authentication-Bypass
In this project I have picked random websites from Google Hacking Website and accessed their admin panel by using SQL Injection and Burpsuite.

Authentication Bypass refers to a method by which an attacker gains access equivalent to an authenticated user without ever going through an authentication procedure.
This is usually the result of the attacker using an unexpected access procedure that does not go through the proper checkpoints where authentication should occur.
It exploits weak authentication mechanisms to allow a hacker to access your systems and data.

Sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections. 

Burp or Burp Suite is a Java based Web Penetration Testing framework which contains a set of tools used for penetration testing of web applications. It is developed by the company named Portswigger. Burp Suite helps you identify vulnerabilities and verify attack vectors that are affecting web applications. Its ease of use makes it the most popular tool among professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters. 

Authentication Bypass can be prevented by strictly adhering to the following remediation measures:
1. In order to stay protected from authentication bypass attack, it is best to keep all your systems, applications, software and OS up-to-date. 
2. It is recommended to patch all vulnerabilities and install a good antivirus program. 
3. Security experts recommend resetting default passwords with unique strong passwords and periodically rotating passwords. 
4.  It is suggested to not expose authentication protocol in the client-side web browser script.
